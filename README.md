# Easygento_InstanceReminder
The Instance Reminder module is used to display a visual top bar to remind you which instance you are working on

How to use the module ?

Go to system configuration on the Easygento section

Enable the module, and just set your favorite Color for your instance.

There are 3 instances by default :
<ul>
<li> development </li>
<li> preprod </li>
<li> production </li>
</ul>

But feel free to set your own instance names using your model,
and adapt the helper.
